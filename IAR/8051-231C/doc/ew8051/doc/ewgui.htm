<h3><a NAME="important"></a>Important information</h3>

<h4>Files needed for uninstallation of the product</h4>

<ul>After installing the IAR Embedded Workbench, you may notice that a
number of files have been placed in a subdirectory to your "Program files"
directory. These files are needed for the InstallShield Wizard to be able
to uninstall the IAR Embedded Workbench. Although deleting these files does
not affect the operation of the IAR Embedded Workbench, it does mean that
you cannot automatically uninstall it.</ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous error dialogs during building</h4>

<ul>If you repeatedly get error dialogs giving generic error messages like
"Error running tool" when building a particular file, the likely cause
is a problem in the tool, not in the IAR Embedded Workbench itself. Most probably
the tool runs into problems dealing with a particular construct in the
input file. There are two different ways of finding the cause of the
problem:<br><br>
<ol type="#"><li>If you have a command-line version of the tool available, run it
with the same options and note if it produces any error messages.
(The options used when running a tool in the IAR Embedded Workbench can be seen in the
Message window if message filtering is set to "all".)</li>
<li>Try to comment out part of the input using #ifdef/#endif, and see if that makes any
difference.</li></ol>
<br>
The cause of the problem may be erroneus input (which arguably should
be reported properly from the tool) or it may be a program error.</ul>

<h4>External editor configuration</h4>

<ul>As different DDE capable editors use different commands, it is necessary
to consult the user documentation supplied with your editor to find the
correct command syntax.<p>

Here are some example configurations for particular editors:<p>

EasyCase<p>

<ul><pre>
Editor:  C:\EASY\Easy-cpp.exe
Service: easy-cpp
Command: system [line($CUR_LINE$)] [load("$FILE_PATH$")]
</pre></ul>

Codewright<p>

<ul><pre>
Editor:  c:\cw32\cw32.exe
Service: Codewright
Command: System BufEditFile $FILE_PATH$ $FILE_PATH$ MovToLine $CUR_LINE$
</pre></ul>

Note that there seems to be a problem with Codewright that can
cause the selected buffer to be activated in the background,
but when bringing Codewright to the foreground, it may revert
to the previously selected buffer. To work around that problem,
use this command configuration instead:<p>
<ul><pre>
System OutputWindow=1
System BufEditFile $FILE_PATH$ $FILE_PATH$ MovToLine $CUR_LINE$
</pre></ul>
The first command is equivalent to clicking on a tab in the
Codewright Output Window, bringing it to the foreground before the
other commands are issued.</ul>

<h4>Avoiding absolute paths in project options</h4>

<ul>In IAR Embedded Workbench 2.31A and later, it is possible to use
argument variables in project options. This makes it possible to make
projects more portable between different environments by avoiding
unnecessary absolute paths. The most obvious use for this is to make
include options and xcl-file options compiler and/or project relative.<p>

Example:<br>
<ul>Setting an include option to "$TOOLKIT_DIR$\inc\" would make the
  build tool look for include files in the "inc" subdirectory of the
  active product (i.e. standard system includes).<p>
  Setting an include option to "$PROJ_DIR$\inc\" would make the
  build tool look for include files in the "inc" subdirectory of the
  current project directory.</ul><p>

For more information about what argument variables are available,
refer to the IAR Embedded Workbench User Guide.</ul></ul>

<h3><a NAME="mcorr"></a>Manual corrections and updates</h3>

<ul>
<h4>EW 2.31C 2000-03-24</h4>

<ul>
<li>The text editor now supports block indent. If you make a selection
    that spans multiple rows, pressing tab will indent the selected
    rows and pressing shift+tab will unindent. This is very handy in
    combination with the "Edit->Match Brackets" command as that allows
    you to select the block containing the caret and repeatedly grow
    the selection if so desired.<p></li>

<li>The "Make Control" page of the settings dialog
    (Options->Settings...), contains an additional check box option:
    "Reload last project at startup". If you uncheck this, the IAR Embedded
    Workbench will not automatically load the last project at startup.<p></li>
</ul>

<h4>EW 2.31B 1999-11-19</h4>

<ul>
<li>The IAR XLINK Linker options control panels have been updated to reflect
    new IAR XLINK Linker features.<p>

    The section "Warnings/Errors" on the "Diagnostics" page contains
    three new fields: "Suppress these diagnostics", "Treat these as
    warnings" and "Treat these as errors". In these fields you can
    give a comma- or space-separated list of diagnostics that you
    want to reclassify. (This corresponds to the "-w" command line option.)
    Example:<p>
	<ul><pre>"Suppress these diagnostics" w26, e106</pre></ul>

    The "Output" page contains a new drop-down list "Module-local
    symbols" that allow you to specify inclusion of module-local
    symbols. (This corresponds to the "-n" command line option.)<p>

    For further information about IAR XLINK Linker options, refer to the file
    "<a href=xman.htm>xman.htm</a>".<p></li>
</ul>

<h4>EW 2.31A 1999-05-28</h4>

<ul>
<li>There are two additional argument variables:<p>

    <b>$EW_DIR$</b> that expands to the directory of the IAR Embedded Workbench,
    for example "c:\iar\ew23".<p>

    <b>$TOOLKIT_DIR$</b> that expands to the directory of the active product,
    for example "c:\iar\ew23\AVR".<p></li>
</ul>

<h4>EW 2.30D 1999-02-17</h4>

<ul>
<li>Virtual Space mode in the editor
    Version 2.30D of the IAR Embedded Workbench introduces a new editor
    option: "Enable Virtual Space". In virtual space mode, you can
    move the text caret into areas that do not contain any text.<p></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="problems"></a>Known problems in current version</h3>

    focus is put on the search string rather than on the filename.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew402"><b>EW402:</b></a>
    Text editor selection highlight is now restored when switching
    between the IAR Embedded Workbench and another application, having the
    "Find" or "Replace" dialogs active.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew407"><b>EW407:</b></a>

<li><a NAME="ew362"><b>EW362:</b></a>
    If the IAR Embedded Workbench is launched by dragging a project file onto
    the application icon the path is now expanded to "long" format rather
    than using the short (8 + 3) path format. (NOTE: This does not work
    on file systems that lack a proper mapping between short and long
    pathnames.)<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew363"><b>EW363:</b></a>
    The IAR Embedded Workbench now properly takes into account maximized and
    minimized states when restoring a project desktop.<p></li>

    Corrected a problem with keyboard navigation in the project options
    dialog.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew314"><b>EW314:</b></a>
    The text editor now correctly resets the undo stack when saving.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew318"><b>EW318:</b></a>
    Corrected a problem that could cause the text editor to fail to
    properly scroll the window to keep the caret visible when typing.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew329"><b>EW329:</b></a>
    Some command accelerators were displayed incorrectly in the menus.
    This has now been fixed.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew330"><b>EW330:</b></a>
    Corrected a problem that under certain circumstances could cause a

    documents to ignore changes to the "Scan for changed files"
	option.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew285"><b>EW285:</b></a>
    Corrected a problem that could cause the foreground window's caret to
    be positioned at an incorrect position when reloading a modified
    binary file.<p></li>
